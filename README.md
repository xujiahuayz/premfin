# Best practice

## Coding Style

We follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding format.
The most important rules above all:

1. Keep code lines length below 80 characters. Maximum 120. Long code lines are NOT readable.
1. We use snake_case to name function, variables. CamelCase for classes.
1. We make our code as DRY (Don't repeat yourself) as possible.
1. We give a description to classes, methods and functions.
1. Variables should be self explaining and just right long:
   - `implied_volatility` is preferred over `impl_v`
   - `implied_volatility` is preferred over `implied_volatility_from_broker_name`

## Do not

1. Do not place .py files at root level (besides setup.py)!
1. Do not upload big files > 100 MB.
1. Do not upload log files.
1. Do not declare constant variables in the MIDDLE of a function
